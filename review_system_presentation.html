        <!-- Slide 1: Title -->
        <div class="slide active">
            <h1>5-Star Review System</h1>
            <p>We built a system that's going to <strong>massively increase your number of 5-star reviews</strong>… and
                <strong>legally block away almost any potential bad review.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We also automatically respond to those reviews.</p>
            <p>And with a few more tweaks, using the latest AI hacks, we can even rank your Google Business Profile
                <span class="highlight">at the top of Google Maps searches in a matter of weeks</span> — not months, not
                years, and not thousands of dollars spent on SEO.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 2: Revenue Increase -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Revenue Increase</h2>
            <p>This fully done-for-you solution will <strong>increase your revenue by at least 30%</strong> without you
                spending a dime more on ads or traditional SEO.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: No Setup Fee -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>No Setup Fee</h2>
            <p>And we'll build it for <strong>free</strong> — meaning no setup fee, zero dollars for installing the
                system.</p>
            <p>We'll just skip that and put you straight on the maintenance cost only, which is there anyway and as
                <strong>low as possible.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Maximum Value -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Maximum Value</h2>
            <p>So basically, <strong>we squeeze every drop of value, every possible benefit from the fact that Google
                    Maps and Google Reviews even exist.</strong> </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Target Audience -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Perfect For Service Businesses</h2>
            <p>So, if you're washing cars, building decks, cleaning houses, or anything similar — and you have a team of
                your own, then I suggest you watch this video.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: What You'll Learn -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>What we gonna cover in this video</h2>
            <ul class="bullet-points">
                <li> Exactly how our system works</li>
                <li> Why it works like a charm</li>
                <li> How long it takes to install</li>
                <li> How fast you'll see results</li>
                <li> What else is included</li>
                <li> How much money it's going to cost you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So that you can easily calculate how much money and time is this going to save you, and how much more
                money can it make for you. You'll also know exactly what guarantees we give
                — and for the main bonus, make sure you stay until the very end. </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 7: Bad Review Impact -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Some statistical facts</h2>

                    <div class="big-number">22%</div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Qualtrics International Inc., a company that provides experience management software, published that a
                single bad review can drive away up to 22% of future business.</p>
            <p>Another fact from the same company, <strong>90%</strong> of buyers check reviews before they make a
                purchase.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 8: People Want the Best -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Consumer Behavior</h2>
            <p>And it makes sense, right? People want the best solutions for themselves — the best products, the best
                services.</p>
            <p>On <strong>Amazon</strong>, for example, there's a filter that lets you sort products by their average
                review rating. But, can you imagine anyone ever clicking anything below the 4+ stars option?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Manual Review Collection Problems</h2>
            <p>Now, if you're still asking for reviews in person or manually, then you know how important that is… but
                you also know how <strong>awkward</strong> it can be.</p>
            <p>With all those follow-ups and responding to comments, your day gets interrupted so many times that you
                might end up <strong>losing hours every day</strong> if you're doing it all manually.</p>
            <p>And if you're not collecting reviews at all — well, you just should.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 11: Fresh Reviews Important -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Fresh Reviews Matter</h2>
            <p>BrightLocal Ltd., a company that provides local SEO tools and services,
                published that <strong>88%</strong> of people trust online reviews as much
                as a personal recommendation from a friend…
                and <strong>85%</strong> of people don't trust reviews older than 3 months.
                So it's also very important to have fresh reviews consistently.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 12: How System Works - Filter First -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>How Our System Works</h2>
            <p>Well, first of all — we don't just blast review requests to everyone. Instead, we reach out to every
                customer and first check <strong>how likely they would rate you with a 5-star review.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 13: Handle Bad Experiences -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Handling Unhappy Customers</h2>
            <p>If someone had a bad experience, and their response contains anything less than 5 — less than great — we
                <strong>ask them for advice instead of a review.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>People love giving advice. And at that point, they feel understood, and believe their feedback has been
                addressed — which it has. Sometimes it's even very useful advice.</p>
            <p class="highlight">They don't stay upset, and more importantly, they don't leave a bad public review.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 14: No-Based Questions -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>"No-Based" Questions</h2>
            <p>Everyone who had a good experience gets invited to leave a review using <strong>"no-based"
                    questions</strong> — a method proven to get far higher response rates than the traditional way.</p>
            <div class="comparison-table">
                <div class="comparison-box traditional">
                    <h3>❌ Traditional</h3>
                    <p>"Hey, would you leave us a review?"</p>

        <!-- Slide 15: Psychology Behind No-Based -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The Psychology</h2>
            <p>Because when people say <strong>"yes,"</strong> they feel open and exposed — like someone tricked them
                into doing something they wouldn't normally do.</p>
            <p>But if they say <strong>"no,"</strong> they feel safe and secure.</p>
            <div class="highlight">This taps into human psychology and gets far more people to actually leave you a good
                review.</div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 16: AI Responses -->
        <div class="slide">

            <p>Then, our AI replies to those comments using their name so it's personalized. Also, we wait a couple of
                hours before responding so it feels natural.</p>
            <p>You'll tell us exactly how you'd like the agent to respond — <strong>extremely professional, funny, or
                    formal.</strong></p>

            <p>Harvard Business Review, in collaboration with TripAdvisor, found that businesses that respond to their

            <p>You'll be asked how you like the offer. If you type something like 1, 2, 3 or 4 (or even words for those

            <p class="highlight">After that, when you type "5," you'll receive the invitation to leave a review.</p>
            <p>There are only two steps — not one,
